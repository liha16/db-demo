# Installation guide

## Database credentials
Change the credentials in db/db.php to your own. Set user, password, host and database name. I have marked them with the comment "// Change".

## Database import
If you do not have the data in the database, run the sql provided in the file "db/sql" and make an import in my phpAdmin (or run the sql direclty). I have named the database "babyApp". If you wish to change, change the sql.
